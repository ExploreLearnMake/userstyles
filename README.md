# Userstyles
A collection of user styles to use with the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#highlights) browser extension. Free to use or misuse as you choose. Pull Requests are welcome! If you find an issue, [please file one](https://github.com/murrayinman/userstyles/issues)!

To easily install a user style, first make sure you have the Stylus (or another UserStyle-compatible) extension. Then find the `.user.css` file you want to install, click to view the file, then click the `Raw` button. Stylus will automatically recognize that it is a UserStyle and ask if you want to install it.
